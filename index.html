								<b>Do...</b> Ask open ended questions allowing the student to arrive at the answer. <Br/> 
								<blockquote>
									<i>Student : </i> - What is the best way to present our project?
									<i>Mentor : </i> - Tell me a time when you watched a presentation that you really loved.
									<i>Student : </i> - I loved when my teacher showed us how to do an expierement in science.
									<i>Mentor : </i> - What did the expierement look like?
									<i>Student : </i> - She showed us how a beaker could overflow if you put to much stuff in it.
									<i>Mentor : </i> - So seeing the beaker explode was your favorite part?
									<i>Student :</i> - Yea!  I loved it so much stuff gushing out, I got an A on the assignment.
									<i>Mentor : </i> - So how could you do something similar with your project?
									<i>Student : </i> - I should show something that is really cool and that makes people remeber the presentation.
 								</blockquote>
							</li>
							<li><b>Do</b> more listening then talking.  In general you should talk 20% of the time and listen 80% of the time.  Think of Yoda :)</li>
							<li><b>Do</b> be ok saying, 'I do not know' to a question that a student asks you.  You are not expected to know everything and there are a ton of people here to help each other with the correct answer.</li>
							<li><b>Do</b> show patience with the students.  When listening give them your full attention, do not check your email and do not assume you know what they are asking.</li>
							<li><b>Do </b> encourage students to use the trello system that we setup for them.</li>
							<li><b>Do </b> give students encouragement about how their projects are going.</li>
							<li><b>Do </b> give students positive encouragement and <b>prizes</b> for how they are doing.</li>
							<li><b>Do </b>tell students what can be achieved in twenty-four hours to help manage their expectations.</li>
							<li><b>Don't </b>treat students as children, treat them as your peers.</li>
							<li><b>Don't </b>simply code the application for the students, let them type it themselves.</li>
							<li><b>Don't </b>bash or belittle projects that you do not like.</li>
							<li><b>Don't </b>dismiss or belittle the devices or technology that the students use.</li>

					<h3>Useful Tools</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-9">
					<p class="instructions">
						<li><b>Making Games</b> - Games are the most common project at Codeday Arizona - Suprise!!  Students are engrossed in playing video games at all times of the event and we highly encourage them to play out their passions inside of the projects they build.  Below are a list of tech resources that students can use to build a game.<br/><br/>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b><a href="">Snap/Scratch</a></b> - This is a simple tool that students can use to litterally snap together if/then statements.  The application is easy to use and extremely easy to learn.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b><a href="">Unity</a></b> - Unity is a professional suite of tools for amaturs and professionals alike.  The platform is used to create cross platform 2d and 3d games.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b><a href="">Constructor 3</a></b>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>Making Art</b> - All great video games have great art work.  There are a lot of students who come to express their artistic creativity, but only know how to do it on paper. 
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b><a href="">GIMP</a></b> - This application is not that easy to learn but it rivals photoshop in its depth and abilities.
								</li>
								<li><b><a href="">Paint!</a></b> - Suprise!  The grand old paint can easily be used to make games, just slap some transparncy on the background and export it to png and you're ready to go.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>Making Music</b> - We highly encourage students to create all aspects of the video games or software that they are making.  Music is another area that an artistic student can articulate themselves in ways that were unimaginable.
							<ul>
								<li><b><a href=""></a></b></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>Creating Stories</b> - A great game or app will have an amazing story behind it.  These applications can be used to help guide the students into how to write stories.
							<ul>
								<li><b><a href=""></a></b></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>Learning to Code</b> - 
							<ul>
								<li><b><a href=""></a></b></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>Project Management</b> - The best part of a project, by the more controlling among us!  Students are offered a pre-setup trello board to use.  How to use it :
							<ul>
								<li>When students start their project we will help them setup differnt 'sections' of the trello board.</li>
								<li>As the event goes on students will move the cards for their project down until they hit a complete category.</li>
								<li>By the end of their project all of their cards should be on the right side.</li>
							</ul>
